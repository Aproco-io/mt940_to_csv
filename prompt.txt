You are tasked with matching information from an MT940 bank statement saved in CSV format with data extracted from various documents such as invoices. Your goal is to create a consolidated CSV output where each line represents a single transfer and includes any potentially connected data from the extracted documents.

Process the MT940 CSV data:
1. Parse the CSV data, identifying each individual transfer.
2. For each transfer, extract relevant information such as date, amount, description, and any other available fields.

Process the extracted data from documents:
1. Analyze the extracted data, looking for information that could be related to the transfers in the MT940 data.
2. Identify key elements such as invoice numbers, amounts, dates, and other relevant details.
3. "+" or "-" in transaction amount in mt940 data mean credit and debit.

Match and combine the information:
1. For each transfer in the MT940 data, attempt to find a match in the extracted document data.
2. Use only those criteria in following order to establish potential connections:
- invoice number from last column in mt940 (it can contains invoice number, look for invoice number from invoice data, it should help you to extract those numbers) with invoice number in invoices data,
- amount compared with transaction amount,
- currency.
3. If a match is found, combine the relevant information from both sources.

Output format:
1. Always use those headers: Account	Date	Amount	Currency	Transaction ID  Invoice number	Match	Invoice Name    Transaction date    Amount  Currency    Invoice number.
2. Create a CSV format output where each line represents a single transfer.
3. Include all relevant fields from the MT940 data.
4. Add column "Match" with info yes or no depends on matching status.
5. If matching data is found in the extracted documents, append this information to the same line.
6. Use commas to separate fields and enclose text fields in double quotes if they contain commas.
7. Create a empty column between column match and Invoice Name.
8. Always include in the output every line from mt940.
9. If line from mt940 doesn't have a match put it at the bottom of the rest of matched lines, sort it.
10. Try to match (by amounts) unmatched invoices until there are no fitting information, if you find another match then change value in match column in relevant line to yes.
11. Add last column, which will display probability of a proper match in a percentages.
12. Sort every line by column match.
13. Analyze what you generated and ensure that every data is inserted in proper column, if not rearrange it.

Important notes:
- Only include the CSV formatted data in your response, use | as a separator. Do not add any explanations or additional text (even word csv).
- Do not add text such us "```csv" or "```".
- Each transfer should be on a single line.
- If no matching data is found in the extracted documents, simply output the MT940 data for that transfer.
- Transaction ID most of the times contains data in this format: "4.2923".
- If you can't find specific info leave it blank, do not insert "NaN".
- If you sort by column match then firsty yes, then no.
- Do not insert percentage value of probability if in this line there is no in match column.

Begin processing the data and output the results in the specified CSV format.
